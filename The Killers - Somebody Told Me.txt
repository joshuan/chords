The Killers - Somebody Told Me

Am Dm F Am >x4
 
Am
Breaking my back just to know your name,
Am                                          Dm       F
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game.
Am
I'm breaking my back just to know your name,
     Am
But heaven ain't close in a place like this,
Am                                        Dm        F
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss.
Am
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this,
Am 
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this.
F                   G                     Am
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight,
 F                                  G
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight.
 
                   Am
    Well, somebody told me,
               F
    You had a boyfriend,
                       G
    Who looked like a girlfriend.
                   E            Am
    That I had in February of last year,
              F
    It's not confidential,
             G          E
    I've got potential.

Am
Ready? Let's roll onto something new,
                                        Dm     F
Taking it's toll and I'm leaving without you.
Am
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this,
Am
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this.
F                   G                  Am
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight,
F                                   G
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight.
 
                   Am
    Well, somebody told me,
               F
    You had a boyfriend,
                      G
    Who looked like a girlfriend.
                   E           Am
    That I had in February of last year,
             F
    It's not confidential,
             G
    I've got potential,
                  E
    A rushin', a rushin' around.
 
        Am        G       F
        Pace yourself for me,
               Am    Dm   F
        I said maybe baby please.
                         Am   G    F
        But I just don't know now,
           E                        G
        When all I wanna do is try.

               Am
Well, somebody told me,
           F

                   G

             E
A rushin', a rushin' around.
