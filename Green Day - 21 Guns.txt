Dm       Bb         F              C
Do you know what's worth fighting for
Dm         Bb        F     C
When it's not worth dying for?
Dm       Bb        F      C
Does it take you breath away
Dm       Bb       F            C

Dm      Bb       F              C
Does the pain weight out the pride?
Dm      Bb       F            C
And you look for a place to hide?
Dm      Bb       F              C
Does someone break your heart inside?

You're in ruins

Dm      Bb       F              C
When you're at the end of the road
Dm       Bb       F              C
And you lost all sense of control
Dm         Bb       F              C
And your thoughts have taken their toll
Dm         Bb       F              C
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Dm    Bb              F      C
Your faith walks on broken glass
Dm       Bb       F       C
And the hangover doesn't pass
Dm        Bb    F        C
Nothing's ever built to last

You're in ruins

Dm       Bb     F            C
Did you try to live on your own
Dm        Bb               F        A
When you burned down the house and home?
Dm        Bb        F           A
Did you stand too close to the fire?
        Bb                  C                F  
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
